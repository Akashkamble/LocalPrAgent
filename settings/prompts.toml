2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Detect possible security risks such as SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, insecure dependencies, or sensitive data exposure.
3. **Performance Considerations**: Evaluate inefficient algorithms, redundant computations, and suggest optimizations where applicable.
4. **Code Style & Best Practices**: Ensure adherence to code language conventions, maintainability, readability, and modularity.
5. **Test Coverage**: Verify if relevant test cases have been added or updated.
